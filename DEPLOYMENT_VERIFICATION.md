   - Test the rollback procedure
   - Verify all external service credentials

2. During Deployment:
   - Follow the step-by-step process in DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Monitor system resources during migration
   - Keep backup system running
   - Verify each step before proceeding

3. Post-Deployment:
   - Monitor application performance
